# Develop-a-generalized-algorithm-to-detect-the-brightness-of-any-image
Develop a generalized algorithm to detect the brightness of any image. Your algorithm should take an image as input and give a score between (0-10) as output (zero being low bright and 10 being high bright). You will not be provided with data for training.
